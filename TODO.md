# TODO LIST

## Features:
[ ] simultaneous fields
[x] replicate strategy (new field strategy to replicate anonymized fields
    from associations onto corresponding fields in denormalized tables)

## Performance:
[x] update vs insert

## Bug fixes:
[x] fix bug in blacklist strategy which was overwriting source db

## General
[x] safety improv: dest_record is passed to field instead of source
